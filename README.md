### Tools Used: 
To develop this project I have used the following: 
-	[JDK ( Java Development Kit)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) 
-	[Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org) 
-	[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) 
-	[Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) 

### OOP and Java Concepts Used: 
 
-	**Association**: Association is mostly used almost every class in this project to make a relation between two separate class through their objects.  
-	**Swing and AWT:** Swing and AWT both are used to design the GUI of the project. 
-	**Abstraction:** Abstraction means using simple things to represent complexity. This OOP concept is used by making different method, objects with specific operation. 
-	**Encapsulation:** Different objects, classes, variables and methods are kept in protective barrier using different type of access modifier to give particular access to particular user of field. 
-	**Polymorphism:** It is used to overload the method that is used in the classes to make easy to do different kind of job by calling different method with same name. 
-	**Package:** Package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. This concept is used to organize the classes used in this project. 

### Limitations and Possible Future Improvements: 
This management software has some limitation. It can be improved for Future like Customer can search the products without any login, the bill details will generate automatically and also employee attendance and salary management will also include, some improvement in GUI will perform.
